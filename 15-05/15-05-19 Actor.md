## Week5, Actor

### Using `become`

```scala
class Counter extends Actor {
  def counter(n: Int): Receive = {
    case "incr" => context.become(counter(n + 1))
    case "get"  => sender ! n
  }
}

def receive = counter(0)
```

Funtionally equivalent to previous version with advantages

- state change is explicit
- state is scoped to current behavior

### Props

[Akka Source - Props](https://github.com/1ambda/akka/blob/master/akka-actor/src/main/scala/akka/actor/Props.scala)

- `Props` is a `ActorRef` configuration object, that is immutable, so it is thread safe and fully sharable.

```scala
// Props.scala

def apply(clazz: Class[_], args: Any*): Props = apply(defaultDeploy, clazz, args.toList)
```

### ActorRef

[Akka Source - ActorRef](https://github.com/1ambda/akka/blob/master/akka-actor/src/main/scala/akka/actor/ActorRef.scala)

> `ActorRef` is a immutable and serializable handle to an actor, which may or may not reside on the local host or inside the same `ActorSytem`. `ActorRef`s can be freely shared among actors by message passing.

### Actor

[Akka Source - Actor](https://github.com/1ambda/akka/blob/master/akka-actor/src/main/scala/akka/actor/Actor.scala)

**Actors are completely independent agents of computation**.

- local execution, no notion of global synchronization
- all actors run fully concurrently
- message-passing primitive is one-way communication

**An Actor is effectively single-threaded**

- messages are received sequentially
- behavior change is effective before processing the next message
- processing one message is atomic unit of execution

**Blocking is replaced by enquueing a message**

### Example Actor Application

```scala
class Main extends Actor {
  val counter = context.actorOf(Props[Counter], "Counter")

  counter ! "incr"
  counter ! "incr"
  counter ! "incr"
  counter ! "get"

  def receive = {
    case count: Int =>
      println(s"count was $count")
      context.stop(self)
  }
}
```
