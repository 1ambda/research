### Future

Futures provide a nice way to reason about performing many operations in parallel in an efficient and non-blocking way.

A Future is a sort of placeholder object that you can create for a result that **does not yet exists**

A `Future` has an important property that it may only be assigned once. Once a Future object is given a value or an exception, it becomes in effect immutable. It can never be overwritten.
